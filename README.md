# Personality_prediction_Using_MBTI
This project is mainly about personality detection using MBTI dataset. We need to give a CSV file in the html page and we basically get the personality of the data present in the dataset.

Download the dataset from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type/.

The above-provided link is for downloading the mbti dataset. This dataset is used for training the model.

After downloading the dataset store the dataset in your Google Drive, the file is accessed from Google Drive and not from the local system.

Run the main.py file and receive a local host IP address(127.0.0.1). Open that local host ip in a browser and your HTML will be displayed.

Now click on Choose file upload your custom dataset (.csv) and click the button and you will get the personality type of the dataset provided.

# Machine Algorithms
We are using three algorithms to train the model. They are

  Gaussian Naive Bayes
  
  Multinomial Naive Bayes
  
  LightGBM

# Implementation
Run the main.py in vscode or any other pythonIDE.

Execute the notebook in the Google Colab. You can even use the Jupyter Notebook to execute the machine code. 

# Custom Dataset
Since to predict the personality we need to give input. So we need to make a .csv file that will include the text(tweets).

Here's a CSV file that I made manually which is in the dataset folder.

You can store this CSV file anywhere you want. There is no restriction for placing this custom-made file in a fixed location as compared to the other files.
