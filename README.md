# Personality_prediction_Using_MBTI
This project is mainly about personality detection using MBTI dataset. We need to give a CSV file in the html page and we basically get the personality of the data present in the dataset.
Download the dataset from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type/.
The above-provided link is for downloading the mbti dataset. This dataset is used for training the model.

After downloading the dataset store the dataset in your Google Drive, the file is accessed from Google Drive and not from the local system.

Run the main.py file and receive a local host IP address(127.0.0.1). Open that local host ip in a browser and your HTML will be displayed.

Now click on Choose file upload your custom dataset (.csv) and click the button and you will get the personality type of the dataset provided.

# Implementation
  Run the main.py in vscode or any other pythonIDE.
  Execute the notebook in the Google Colab. You can even use the Jupyter Notebook to execute the machine code.
